# Random Meal Generator

## User Story

As a foodie, I want a meal recommendation from a particular region in the world so that I can prepare it for myself to eat!

## Overview
A user inputs a desired country/region and is given a random meal from that region.

A user is given ingredients and directions for the meal, along with an image of the meal. The user may choose to remember the meal as a "favorite" which will be displayed on the home screen so they can quickly refer to the recipe later.

The user is also given a random cocktail to go along with the meal.
